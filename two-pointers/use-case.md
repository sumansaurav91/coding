## Two Pointers Pattern

* Linear Data Structure: Input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string
* Process Pairs: Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously
* Dynamic Pointer Movement: Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. Both pointers might move along same or two different data structures.
